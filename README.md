disaster management


We’ll be building an app using android studio that basically takes email-id and phone number of the user .We’ll be recording these information about the user in a SQL database . The app would basically use API services that could predict or provide information regarding any future potential disasters to it’s users .Our app would  send SOS alerts in case there is no connectivity in case of remote locations.

We’’ll be building a chatbot and would integrate it to the app .The chatbot would basically help the users to get familiar with the app and how one should use it additionally the chatbot would help the users with preventive measures during a disaster or after that.

For management purpose our app would be using GPS services .After the disaster has taken place ,our idea is to help people who are trapped in affected areas where emergency crew can’t reach .Using those GPS(Maps API) information the govt can help by sending drones to help the people with basic necessities and future monitoring.

Furthermore, after the disaster management can be done by human aid that includes help with money ,We’ll be integrating an online payment service with our app so that people can directly transfer some money to help the sufferers.

As it’s quite frequently observed that there is lot of after effects of disaster , for ex. After tsunami hits ,there is stagnant water which can lead to diseases like malaria , which accounts for increasing the count of dying population .We’ll be basically monitoring those situations and save as much lives as possible.
